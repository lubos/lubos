As a user of [Manager.io](https://www.manager.io), you might need support, want to report bugs, or request new features. To help address your needs quickly and efficiently, here are some guidelines on how to write an effective email.

## Identify the Purpose of Your Email

Clearly state whether you are seeking support, reporting a bug, or requesting a new feature. This helps understand the context of your email right away. A specific and concise subject line is crucial. For example, instead of writing “Help needed,” a more precise subject like “Bug Report: Issue with Invoice Generation” will convey the purpose immediately.

## Keep It Simple and Focused

Send single-topic emails. This means each email should address only one issue, question, or request. Complex emails containing multiple points or questions can be difficult to resolve quickly and may lead to longer back-and-forth exchanges. If you have multiple concerns, prioritize them and send separate emails for each one. This way, each issue can be addressed individually and more efficiently.

### Why Single-Topic Emails are Better

- **Easier to Track:** Each email can be treated as a single task on the to-do list.
- **Quicker Resolution:** With a clear focus, faster and more detailed responses can be provided.
- **Less Confusion:** Avoids mixing up different issues, which can lead to misunderstandings.

## Use an Informal and Detailed Style

Emails that are informal yet detailed are preferred. Formal emails take longer to read and often add no additional value. Detailed emails save time by reducing the need for follow-up questions. When writing your email, include all relevant details right from the start, such as:

- The version of Manager.io being used.
- Any relevant account details.
- Specific error messages or issues encountered.

## Provide Relevant Attachments and Information

Including attachments and additional information can significantly speed up the process. Here’s how you can help:

- **Accounting Files:** If possible, attach your accounting file or provide access to it.
- **Step-by-Step Instructions:** Provide clear instructions on how to find the relevant screen or reproduce the issue.
- **Screenshots:** If you encounter an error, attach a screenshot. This provides context and technical details that can be crucial for troubleshooting.

## Trust the Process

Once you’ve sent your email, trust that a response will come as soon as possible. If your email is in the mailbox, rest assured that it’s on the to-do list. There is no need for follow-up reminders, as prompt and efficient responses are a priority.

## Examples of Well-Written and Poorly-Written Emails

### Good Example
