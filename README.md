# üëã Welcome Open-Source Programmers!

Are you passionate about open-source and interested in making accounting software more accessible worldwide? Manager.io, a free double-entry accounting system, is on a mission to empower small businesses and individuals globally by providing country-specific integrations that meet local regulatory and compliance requirements.

## Why Contribute?

Through our **GitHub Sponsors** program, Manager.io will support developers who create and maintain these country-specific integrations. Starting at **\$1,000 USD per month**, sponsored developers will have the opportunity to grow their sponsorship as their integrations become valuable to users in their country and beyond.

## Your Mission

We‚Äôre looking for talented programmers to build integrations that make Manager.io truly global. This includes:

* **e-Invoicing:** Automated compliance with country-specific invoicing standards.
* **Payroll Calculations:** Tailored payroll calculations for local tax and social security requirements.
* **Tax Reporting:** Generate country-specific tax reports.
* **Bank Feeds:** Integrate local bank feeds for seamless transaction imports.

## Why Manager.io?

Manager.io‚Äôs desktop edition is entirely free, providing anyone, anywhere, with accessible accounting software. With your help, we can extend its functionality to meet local needs, making it truly universal.

## How to Get Started

1. **Get Familiar with Manager.io**
   Before diving into development, take some time to explore [Manager.io](https://www.manager.io) to understand how it works and its core features.

2. **Connect with Local Accountants**
   Visit our [Manager.io Accountants Directory](https://www.manager.io/accountants) to connect with accountants in your country who are already using Manager.io. They can provide insights into the specific functionality needed for local compliance and will serve as your first users and testers.

3. **Plan Your Integration**
   Decide which feature you‚Äôd like to develop for your country based on feedback from accountants. Whether it‚Äôs payroll, tax, invoicing, or bank feeds, you‚Äôll be creating something that addresses real needs in your market.

4. **Build with Manager.io Extensions**
   Manager.io integrations must be implemented as [Extensions](https://www.manager.io/guides/extensions), which are HTML/JavaScript files running in an **IFRAME** inside Manager. These extensions form the client-side component of your integration.

   If your extension also requires server-side functionality (e.g. to interact with APIs or databases), you are free to use **any technology stack** for that part‚ÄîNode.js, Python, .NET, Go, etc.

5. **Maintain Ownership**
   Each project belongs to the programmer who develops it. You can host it on your GitHub account, set your own contribution guidelines, and manage it independently.

6. **Sponsorship Growth**
   Sponsorships start at **\$1,000 USD per month** and can increase as your project proves valuable to a larger user base. The more useful and widely adopted your integration becomes, the more support you‚Äôll receive.

7. **Join the Developer Forum**
   Join the [Manager.io Developers Group](https://forum.manager.io/g/developers) on our community forum. This is where you can collaborate with others, ask technical questions, and get guidance from the Manager.io team.

8. **Build a Minimum Viable Extension**
   Implement a minimal but functional solution to a real-world problem as a [Manager.io Extension](https://www.manager.io/guides/extensions). To qualify for sponsorship, your extension must:

   * Be **open-source** and hosted publicly (e.g. on GitHub)
   * Be **verified to work**‚Äîit should be tested and actively used by at least a few businesses
   * Solve a **real, country-specific need** (e.g. tax report, payroll calculation, e-invoice format)

   Once your extension meets these criteria, GitHub sponsorship will be granted.

## What Makes a Great Integration?

We‚Äôre looking for integrations that are not just functional‚Äîbut also **reliable, well-documented, and actively maintained**. Here‚Äôs what success typically looks like:

* ‚úÖ **Solves a Real Problem:** The integration addresses a specific regulatory, tax, or financial reporting need in your country.
* üß™ **Tested by Real Users:** You‚Äôve collaborated with local accountants or businesses who rely on your integration in production.
* üìö **Clear Documentation:** You've written setup instructions, usage examples, and troubleshooting tips to help others adopt your integration.
* üîÑ **Actively Maintained:** Bugs are fixed promptly, and improvements are made as regulations or Manager.io itself evolves.
* üåç **Adoption Beyond Borders:** Some of the most successful integrations are adapted for multiple countries with similar requirements‚Äîfeel free to expand your reach.

Even if your first version is simple, you can grow it over time into a robust solution that provides lasting value.

## Requirements

While experience with accounting and ERP systems is helpful, it‚Äôs not required. A willingness to engage with the Manager.io Extension framework, reach out to local accountants for feedback, and a commitment to creating and maintaining a high-quality integration are the primary expectations.
