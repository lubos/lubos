# How to Write Me an Email

As a user or customer of Manager.io, you likely reach out to me for support, to report bugs, or to request new features. To help me respond to your needs as quickly and efficiently as possible, here are some guidelines on how to write an effective email.

## Identify the Purpose of Your Email

When you write to me, clearly state whether you are seeking support, reporting a bug, or requesting a new feature. This helps me understand the context of your email right away. A specific and concise subject line is crucial. For example, instead of writing “Help needed,” a more precise subject like “Bug Report: Issue with Invoice Generation” will grab my attention and let me know exactly what your email is about.

## Keep It Simple and Focused

I encourage you to send single-topic emails. This means each email should address only one issue, question, or request. Complex emails that contain multiple points or questions can be difficult to resolve quickly and may lead to longer back-and-forth exchanges. If you have multiple concerns, prioritize them and send separate emails for each one. This way, we can address each issue individually and more efficiently.

### Why Single-Topic Emails are Better

- **Easier to Track:** Each email can be treated as a single task on my to-do list.
- **Quicker Resolution:** With a clear focus, I can provide a faster and more detailed response.
- **Less Confusion:** Avoids mixing up different issues, which can lead to misunderstandings.

## Use an Informal and Detailed Style

I prefer emails that are informal yet detailed. Formal emails take longer to read and often add no additional value. Detailed emails, on the other hand, save time by reducing the need for me to ask follow-up questions. When writing your email, include all relevant details right from the start. This might include:

- The version of Manager.io you are using.
- Any relevant account details.
- Specific error messages or issues you are encountering.

## Provide Relevant Attachments and Information

Including attachments and additional information can significantly speed up the process. Here’s how you can help:

- **Accounting Files:** If possible, attach your accounting file or provide access to it.
- **Step-by-Step Instructions:** Provide clear instructions on how to find the relevant screen or reproduce the issue.
- **Screenshots:** If you encounter an error, attach a screenshot. This provides context and technical details that can be crucial for troubleshooting.

## Trust the Process

Once you’ve sent your email, trust that I will respond as soon as possible. If your email is in my mailbox, rest assured that it’s on my to-do list. There is no need for follow-up reminders. I prioritize responding promptly and efficiently.

## Examples of Well-Written and Poorly-Written Emails

### Good Example
