# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome Open-Source Programmers!

Are you passionate about open-source and interested in making accounting software more accessible worldwide? Manager.io, a free double-entry accounting system, is on a mission to empower small businesses and individuals globally by providing country-specific integrations that meet local regulatory and compliance requirements.

## Why Contribute?

Through our **GitHub Sponsors** program, Manager.io will support developers who create and maintain these country-specific integrations. Starting at **$1,000 USD per month**, sponsored developers will have the opportunity to grow their sponsorship as their integrations become valuable to users in their country and beyond.

## Your Mission

Weâ€™re looking for talented programmers to build integrations that make Manager.io truly global. This includes:

- **e-Invoicing:** Automated compliance with country-specific invoicing standards.
- **Payroll Calculations:** Tailored payroll calculations for local tax and social security requirements.
- **Tax Reporting:** Generate country-specific tax reports.
- **Bank Feeds:** Integrate local bank feeds for seamless transaction imports.

## Why Manager.io?

Manager.ioâ€™s desktop edition is entirely free, providing anyone, anywhere, with accessible accounting software. With your help, we can extend its functionality to meet local needs, making it truly universal.

## How to Get Started

1. **Get Familiar with Manager.io**  
   Before diving into development, take some time to explore [Manager.io](https://www.manager.io) to understand how it works and its core features.

2. **Connect with Local Accountants**  
   Visit our [Manager.io Accountants Directory](https://www.manager.io/accountants) to connect with accountants in your country who are already using Manager.io. They can provide insights into the specific functionality needed for local compliance and will serve as your first users and testers.

3. **Plan Your Integration**  
   Decide which feature youâ€™d like to develop for your country based on feedback from accountants. Whether itâ€™s payroll, tax, invoicing, or bank feeds, youâ€™ll be creating something that addresses real needs in your market.

4. **Use Any Technology**  
   Manager.io offers a flexible **API** that allows you to work in the programming language and framework of your choice. Find the API documentation [here](https://manager.readme.io/reference) to get started.

5. **Maintain Ownership**  
   Each project belongs to the programmer who develops it. You can host it on your GitHub account, set your own contribution guidelines, and manage it independently.

6. **Sponsorship Growth**  
   Sponsorships start at **$1,000 USD per month** and can increase as your project proves valuable to a larger user base. The more useful and widely adopted your integration becomes, the more support youâ€™ll receive.

## Requirements

While experience with accounting and ERP systems is helpful, itâ€™s not required. A willingness to engage with the Manager.io API, reach out to local accountants for feedback, and a commitment to creating and maintaining a high-quality integration are the primary expectations.
